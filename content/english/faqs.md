  title: "**Frequently Asked Questions**"
  items:
    - question: "How does Aleph Archives invoice for social media users?"
      answer: "For social media, we invoice for every profile or page, across all networks."

    - question: "What should I do if the list of internal domains is incorrect?"
      answer: "To ensure accurate billing, Aleph Archives needs to have a list of all internal domains. Even domains that aren’t archived but are internal to your company are required to help the system calculate usage. In some cases, domains our system discovered may have been added to your domains dashboard.\n\nIf the domains listed are incorrect, please contact Aleph Archives Support."

    - question: "What is Aleph Archives web archiving service?"
      answer: "Aleph Archives is the industry’s leading web content collection and preservation platform considered the Gold Standard in legal defensibility and trusted by Fortune 500 and Am Law 100 companies alike. KEN, the foundation of the Aleph Archives Platform, enables organizations to collect, preserve, and analyze web content for litigation, internal audits and forensic investigations."

    - question: "What other products form part of the Aleph Archives Platform?"
      answer: "Aleph Archives KEN is the core offering in the Aleph Archives Platform. Over time, we will be releasing new product categories like RAY that include solutions for proactively controlling the escalating costs and risks associated with internal and customer-facing web content and for organizations looking to harness, analyze and act on intelligence from the web (the world’s largest source of unstructured data)."
    - question: "Can I get an on-premise version of Aleph Archives Solutions?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Enterprise customers can purchase an On-Premises version of Aleph Archives Solutions through our sales organization."

    - question: "How does Aleph Archives work?"
      answer: "Essentially, Aleph Archives's software visits a website and collects what a person would see, and we store the content exactly as it was delivered from the target site. We navigate through the site, so we get all of the web pages and related content you need, including text and metadata from each page. We also make a PDF and PNG of each page and store that alongside the native web content.\n\nOnce the collection is complete, we make a working replica (links work, videos play, etc.) of the site available so you can see how the site performed when it was live. We also create exports using the PDFs of each page and the native content."

    - question: "What is ISO 28500?"
      answer: "ISO 28500 is the standard for web content collection and preservation. It was designed by an international body of experts in digital preservation. It specifies a methodology for collection and it specifies a storage format called a WARC file."

    - question: "Why are the ISO 28500 standard and WARC files relevant to my organization?"
      answer: "No matter what your reason for capturing web content, there are two things you don't want:\n1. You don't want to be trapped in a proprietary format that works with only one vendor\n2. You don't want your captured web content to be un-viewable in the future\n\nISO 28500 WARCs make sure you avoid both of those issues. Virtually all other web capture methods are susceptible to those problems, and that's what Aleph Archives wants to avoid for our clients."
    - question: "What is a WARC?"
      answer: "A WARC file is an industry-standard format for storing collected web content and associated data. A WARC file is a container that provides structure to the data for processing, indexing and access. More importantly, a WARC file will preserve original web content exactly as it was delivered from the target site. It contains all of the metadata that allows a forensic examiner to verify the integrity of captured web content."

    - question: "What is native format web content?"
      answer: "Native format web content is the unaltered format in which the web content was originally delivered to a browser. It includes all of the components that make up a web page: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, text, etc. It is critical for authentication and forensics purposes when collecting web content."

    - question: "What constitutes difficult-to-capture content?"
      answer: "There is a huge amount of web technology that makes it easy for people to use websites but also makes it very difficult for many capture tools (except Aleph Archives, of course) to harvest. Essentially, it is content that requires interaction with a web page; think drop-down list selections, mouse-overs, pop-ups, multimedia, ...etc."

    - question: "Is Aleph Archives a software or a service?"
      answer: "Both. Aleph Archives provides options to use the software as a service (SaaS) and under a license (on-premise)."

    - question: "How many hops? How many levels deep in a site can you go?"
      answer: "You control the number of hops and how many levels deep you want to go. Aleph Archives generally recommends +1 hop. For example, if a Facebook profile has links in posts or comments to sites outside of Facebook, Aleph Archives will follow each link and capture the resulting web page, but no links from that web page."

    - question: "Can I use this with Relativity™?"
      answer: "Yes. Aleph Archives provides a Relativity .DAT file as a standard part of every capture. You can load content into virtually any eDiscovery review platform."

    - question: "Is it just a screenshot?"
      answer: "No, it is much more than a screenshot. With Aleph Archives, any captured web content looks and works like it did when it was live on the web. Screenshots give you no interactivity, and they miss critical content on modern web pages."
