## How to Archive a Website for Legal and Compliance: The Aleph Archives Advantage

If you're searching for how to archive a website and have found yourself here, it's likely because you've already discovered that traditional methods like screenshots, open-source tools, or CMS backups simply don't meet your legal and compliance requirements.

### The Website Archiving Challenge in 2025

As websites become increasingly complex, the challenges of proper archiving have grown exponentially. Today's digital landscape demands more sophisticated solutions than ever before—especially for organizations facing strict regulatory requirements.

#### How (NOT) To Archive a Website

As you may have already discovered, many common approaches to website archiving are fundamentally flawed:

- **Screenshots** create a collection of static images without metadata, search capabilities, or proper organization—making them virtually useless for compliance or legal purposes.

- **CMS backups** primarily serve IT recovery needs but lack critical compliance features like digital signatures, metadata preservation, and tamper-proof storage.

- **Open-source tools** require significant technical expertise, lack proper support, and typically fail to capture dynamic content that defines modern web experiences.

When regulatory compliance or legal defensibility is at stake, these inadequate methods create significant organizational risk. That's why forward-thinking organizations are turning to Aleph Archives for enterprise-grade web archiving solutions.

### What is Website Archiving?

True website archiving goes far beyond simple backups or snapshots. It's a comprehensive process that captures, preserves, and makes accessible complete records of your digital presence—including all dynamic elements, interactive features, and underlying metadata.

Unlike competitors who offer partial solutions, Aleph Archives provides complete digital preservation that maintains the integrity, authenticity, and accessibility of your web content. Our approach ensures that archived websites remain legally defensible, fully searchable, and easily retrievable whenever needed.

### Who Needs to Archive Their Website?

Organizations across industries require proper website archiving for various critical purposes:

#### For Industry Compliance

In regulated sectors, website archiving isn't optional—it's mandatory. Financial institutions governed by SEC and FINRA regulations, healthcare organizations subject to strict medical advertising rules, and government agencies facing transparency requirements all need robust archiving solutions.

While competitors like PageFreezer and MirrorWeb offer basic compliance tools, Aleph Archives has pioneered industry-specific archiving protocols that automatically adapt to evolving regulatory requirements across sectors. Our platform includes built-in compliance frameworks for:

- Financial services (SEC, FINRA, FCA)
- Healthcare and pharmaceutical (FDA, HHS)
- Government and public sector (FOIA, transparency laws)
- Insurance and risk management

- Energy and utilities


#### For Legal Protection and eDiscovery

When legal disputes arise, having a verifiable record of your website's historical content becomes invaluable. Aleph Archives provides court-admissible evidence with tamper-evident seals and cryptographic verification that exceeds the capabilities of competitors like Hanzo.

Our historical archives maintain the full functionality and appearance of your website, creating a living digital museum that surpasses the static captures offered by competing solutions.

### Why CMS Backups Are Not Web Archives

Many organizations mistakenly believe their CMS backup system provides adequate archiving. This dangerous misconception can lead to serious compliance gaps and legal vulnerabilities.
