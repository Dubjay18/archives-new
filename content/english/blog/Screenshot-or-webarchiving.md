## The Evolution of Web Content Archiving

Since 2010, web content archiving has presented significant challenges for organizations worldwide. The primary objective has been to discover a comprehensive solution capable of capturing, preserving, and accurately replaying internet content. Many initiatives attempted to build crawling software using outdated technology, resulting in inconsistent performance and unreliable outcomes.

Among these efforts, a select few private ventures successfully developed Enterprise-Grade Web Archiving Platforms. Aleph Archives pioneered this field with CAMA, the first On-premises/Cloud Web Archiving Platform capable of capturing web content in its native format and replaying it upon request. Subsequently, Aleph Archives continued to innovate by introducing the industry's first WARC file viewer.

During this period, regulatory bodies worldwide strengthened bookkeeping rules and procedures to protect consumers increasingly exposed to web-based commercial content. To fulfill their oversight responsibilities, these regulators must effectively supervise and monitor all marketing content published online. Particular attention has been directed toward strategic sectors, including telecommunications, financial services, and the rapidly expanding online retail industry.

## Why is a Screenshot Not Sufficient?

A screenshot merely represents a digital image of what appears on your computer screen. Service providers offering screenshot capabilities are essentially providing you with a picture of your content. While this may address basic requirements, modern compliance standards demand more robust solutions, as screenshots lack fundamental integrity verification mechanisms.

There is only one appropriate methodology for web archiving: preserving web content in WARC files. The WARC file format is defined by ISO 28500:2017, which includes comprehensive specifications that we encourage you to review: [ISO 28500:2017](https://www.iso.org/standard/68004.html).

Fortunately, Aleph Archives offers technology that provides both the essential WARC file and standard shareable formats including PDF, PNG, and HTML. Aleph Archives platforms guarantee archive integrity through a dual-secure signature system utilizing SHA512 and RIPEMED authentication protocols for every archived item.
